# MAE-segmentation-topoloss
I imported topological loss function in the segmentation part of Point-MAE.

All the dependencies are just as the same of Point-MAE, but adding a lib called torch_topological, which needs python3.10 torch2.1.2

Substituting the segmentation file in Point-MAE to this one, and do runcode.

Now the project is not finished yet, but available for running. In the future I would try to improve its efficiency of training and increase the accuracy of segementation.
