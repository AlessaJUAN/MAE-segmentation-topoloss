# MAE-segmentation-topoloss
I imported topological loss function in the segmentation part of Point-MAE.

All the dependencies are just as the same of Point-MAE, but adding a lib called torch_topological, which needs python3.10 torch2.1.2

Substituting the segmentation file in Point-MAE to this one, and do runcode.
